# DWP Design Repository

The design repository is a collection of mission patches, posters and stickers that have been created and shared accross the department.

## Contributing

If you have a sticker you want to add, you will need to zip the print ready files, add a .html page to the views folder and add it to the list on the gallery page.

### File names

File names should be consistent. The .html file should match the preview image, and the zip file should also match followed by the type of resource it is.

eg:

`dwp-dinosaur.html` - the page  
`dwp-dinosaur.png` - the preview image  
`dwp-dinosaur-sticker.zip` - the print ready files
